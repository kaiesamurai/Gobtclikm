# Gobtclikm

Gobtclikm is a Bitcoin Lightning Network marketplace dedicated to buying and selling stock photos and illustrations. Unlike traditional stock sites that charge high commissions, Gobtclikm leverages Lightning Network's micropayment capabilities to offer low-cost transactions with minimal fees, ensuring photographers receive more of their earnings.

## Inspiration

Current stock sites often impose significant commissions (25%-60%), reducing photographers' earnings from each sale. Gobtclikm aims to provide a fairer platform where creators retain a larger share of their sales revenue.

## What it Does

Gobtclikm facilitates the seamless buying and selling of stock photos and illustrations using Bitcoin over the Lightning Network. Users can browse, purchase, and license high-quality images directly from photographers.

## How We Built It

Gobtclikm is built using React for the frontend and Blockstack for decentralized identity and storage, ensuring user data privacy and security.

## What's Next for Gobtclikm

- **Payment Integration:** Enhance the checkout process with automated Lightning Network payments.
- **Automated Withdrawal:** Enable photographers to withdraw earnings automatically to their Bitcoin wallets.
- **Social Sharing Buttons:** Implement social media sharing features to increase exposure and engagement.
